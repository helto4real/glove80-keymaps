# Swedish QWERTY modified version of the "Glorious Engrammer" keymap for MoErgo Glove80

This is my Glove80 keymap forked from the awesome @sunaku work v42 RC.


See [Sunaku's original Githubpage](https://github.com/sunaku/glove80-keymaps) for details about the keybindings and other key information.
A huge thank you for his work and please support him if you like his work. Kept his original licence information below.

## Noteworthy changes
- Added Swedish characters åäöÅÄÖ tp the base layer (QWERTY)

## Todo
- Not all keys are correctly mapped yet to swedish counterparts in all layers but the most important ones are done.
- Smarter mappings in code to make it easier to adopt new versions from the original repo.
